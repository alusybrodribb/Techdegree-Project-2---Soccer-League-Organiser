SOCCER LEAGUE ORGANISER BY ALISON BRODRIBB
**********************************************
Alison (Lusy) Brodribb (nee Parker)
September 2016

This is my second Java application, which I am making as part of
the Treehouse Techdegree

*******************
RUNNING THE PROGRAM

To run program, go to program folder in command prompt and run the following:
java -cp bin LeagueManager

Follow menu prompts to add teams, add & remove players, and view team stats

*****************

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

-Add a review step prior to team creation, so organiser can confirm that team and coach name are entered correctly.
-Add in code so that organiser can remove teams and amend coach/tean name
-Add in more flexibility to code logic so program can handle player lists of any number of players
-I've tried to break the menu prompts every way I can think of, but I may have forgotten something - please let me know if you find anything I can improve on!
